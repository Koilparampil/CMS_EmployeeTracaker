# CMS_EmployeeTracker 

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT%20License-brightgreen)
## Description 
This is a content management system that runs on the command line to manage a company's employee database using Node.js and Inquirer and MySQL. This was also made so that a business owner could be able to view the departments, roles and employees of their company. This helps solve the problem of organizing all of your employees into roles. In doing this project I learned how to use Node.js in parallel with a MySQL server. This waas faciliated by the mysql2 npm package. I learned a bit more about some of the nuances of the Inquirer package as well.

## Installation
For this Project you had to install two NPM packages, Inquirer and mysql2, and you also had to already have had Node.JS installed. To install Inquirer and mysql2 all you have to do is call `npm i mysql2` and `npm i inquirer` these commands have to be run in the terminal at the file location in which you are running the application. For this specific application you can skip the manual installation process and just type `npm i` into the terminal at the root and both packages will automatically be installed for you.
## Usage
Using this software is simple. After installing the required dependencies, all you have to do is run `node .\index.js` in the file directory that the code lives in. The Code will guide you in doing the rest. All you have to do is answer the questions that the code will ask you. To exit the code and write the file, you just have to choose the `Quit` option in the menu.

## Collaborators

I have to thank the creators of the mysql2 and Inquirer packages, for whom without, I would not be able to have completed this project in such an efficient manner. I would like to also thank W3Schools for their tutorials on switch statements, it helped me a lot. MDN also deserves recognition for all their documentation on Javascript.
